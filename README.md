# Public-Portfolio
Includes samples of my coding projects that showcase my knowledge and level of skill pertaining to various programming languages

Thank you for taking a look at the various projects I have worked on over the past few years! I have included in the portfolio projects that I felt were noteworthy or that display a variety of skills associated with each programming language.

The projects included in this portfolio include both course work and personal projects that I have worked on over the past few years in order to develop my skills. Any web pages or books used for reference or to provide examples are cited in the comments at the top of the files, or provide the necessary copyright information at the bottom. 

Links to the working web applications can be found in the short descriptions for the HTML files as well as in the comments.

The JavaScript examples also contain links to my CodePen where they demonstrate functionality. These links are also found in the short description and within the comments of the HTML files.

The Java projects contain the functioning code, but will have to be exported to an IDE in order to view the output. Examination of the code itself should provide insight into my thought process and style.
